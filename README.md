# Internet-Protocol-Suite

INTRODUCTION

In these projects, I explore the applications of Data Communications and Networks by using a virtual machine for Ubuntu. With virtual machine, I am able to develop a simulation that conveys the network connectivity between PC's, Switches, and Routers. This simulation is possible by using Packet Tracer from Cisco Network Academy. 

SOFTWARE USED

VirtualBox: VirtualBox allows me to open the Virtual Machine, run by Ubuntu OS. With VirtualBox, I have control over the amount of virtual memory required, and the speed in which my virtual machine runs by configuring the settings in the Motherboard. 

Packet Tracer: Once I run the virtual machine, I open the Cisco Packet Tracer from the OS's terminal. This allows me to engineer a simulation of network connectivity between devices.

PROJECT 1

In Project 1, I configure switch configurations, as well as IP addressing on switches and PCs. I then test network connectivity by implementing ping requests in the PC's command prompt. 

PROJECT 2

In Project 2, I implement a router to my earlier system design from PROJECT 1. I connect the switches to the router via the FastEthernet Interface. Additionally, I configured a default gateway in the switches and the PCs in order to allow these devices to communicate across multiple networks.

PROJECT 3

I focus on using VLANs for project 3. This allows me to reduce congestion in a LAN and organize PCs to particular access networks.
