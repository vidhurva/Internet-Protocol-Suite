# Internet-Protocol-Suite

INTRODUCTION

In these projects, I explore the applications of Data Communications and Networks by using a virtual machine for Ubuntu. With virtual machine, I am able to develop a simulation that conveys the network connectivity between PC's, Switches, and Routers. This simulation is possible by using Packet Tracer. 

SOFTWARE USED

VirtualBox: VirtualBox allows me to open the Virtual Machine, run by Ubuntu OS. With VirtualBox, I have control over the amount of virtual memory required, and the speed in which my virtual machine runs by configuring the settings in the Motherboard. 

Packet Tracer: Once I run the virtual machine, I open the Cisco Packet Tracer from the OS's terminal. This allows me to engineer a simulation of network connectivity between devices.
